# HandGestureRecogniser

# As Seen on TikTok and Twitch

This is the Hand Gesture Recogniser as seen on https://www.tiktok.com/@4o4our and https://www.twitch.tv/4o4our

This is our very first TikTok/Twitch Project, a hand gesture recogniser, it uses Node.JS and our Webcam to analyse our hand and recognise gestures it will be making and count fingers.
